# AI-on-ARS
## Implementing one of the best and newest algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.

**This project is implementation of the great [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055) from University of California, Berkeley and influenced by Open Source community.**

##### I Used Spyder and Anaconda for developing my experiment but feel free to use any tool you are comfortable with.

* My code is compatible with any pybullet envs such as half cheetah, hopper, pendulum, etc, with a slight value change. But select it considering your Computer Power. You can also use MuJoCo for env.
* Due to simplicity of ARS, you will not need to import TensorFlow or PyTorch in order to execute. You will only need NumPy. That's awesome, Right?
